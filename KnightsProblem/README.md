Knights Problem:

The aim is to figure out the minimal number of chess knights necessary to attack every square on a chess board. This means our chessboard must be at least 3x4 for some number of knights to be able to attack all squares on the board because a knight can only attack certain squares relative to its own location. The knight can attack, at most, 8 squares, fewer when positioned along an edge.
